            <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Electric buses are vehicles powered by electric motors, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional diesel-powered buses. These buses run on electricity stored in batteries, which are typically charged at depots or through specialized charging infrastructure along their routes. The charging infrastructure can include fast-charging stations at key points or wireless charging technology embedded in the road.</p> 
            <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">By eliminating tailpipe emissions, electric buses contribute to cleaner air in urban areas and reduce the carbon footprint of public transportation. Additionally, they are quieter than conventional buses, enhancing the overall quality of life in cities.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Trams and light rail systems, powered by electricity, are increasingly being integrated into urban transportation networks as sustainable and efficient alternatives to traditional vehicles. These systems, often connected to the city's electrical grid, offer an eco-friendly solution to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions.</p> 
            <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">With their ability to carry large numbers of passengers, trams and light rails help alleviate traffic congestion and improve air quality in densely populated areas. Moreover, their quiet operation and energy efficiency make them an attractive option for cities striving to meet sustainability goals and promote green transportation solutions.</p>

            <h1 style="background-color:violet;text-align:center;">Level 1: (Slow Charging)</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Electric vehicles (EVs) that use a standard household outlet for charging are designed for convenience and ease of use, making them ideal for overnight charging. These outlets, typically delivering 120 volts, allow drivers to plug in their vehicles at home without the need for specialized equipment. Though this method of charging may be slower compared to dedicated fast chargers, it is perfectly suited for individuals who have ample time to let their vehicles charge overnight. This cost-effective and accessible option promotes the adoption of EVs by reducing the initial setup required, making it a practical solution for those with a reliable, daily charging schedule.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) units are essential for efficiently charging electric vehicles (EVs), providing a faster and more reliable charging experience compared to standard outlets. These dedicated charging stations are commonly installed in both public spaces, such as parking lots, and private residential areas. They are designed to support the higher power demands of EVs, significantly reducing charging time and making electric vehicles more practical for daily use. By offering quicker charging, EVSE units encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, contributing to the shift towards cleaner, more sustainable transportation systems.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Rapid charging stations, commonly located along highways or at dedicated charging hubs, are crucial for supporting the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). These stations provide high-powered charging, often capable of replenishing an EV's battery to 80% in just about 30 minutes. This quick turnaround reduces downtime for drivers on long trips, making EVs more convenient and accessible for everyday use. By offering fast, reliable charging infrastructure, these stations play a vital role in reducing range anxiety and encouraging more people to transition to cleaner, more sustainable transportation options.</p>

        <h1 style="background-color:yellow;text-align:center;">Bike-Sharing</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Bike-sharing programs and pedestrian-friendly zones play a vital role in promoting sustainable urban mobility. By offering easy access to bicycles and creating safe, walkable areas, cities can reduce dependence on cars, cutting down on traffic congestion and pollution. These initiatives encourage residents to adopt healthier, more active lifestyles by walking or cycling for short trips. Bike-sharing programs provide a convenient, eco-friendly transportation option, while pedestrian zones create vibrant, community-focused spaces that prioritize safety and well-being. Together, these efforts help cities become more sustainable, livable, and resilient to environmental challenges.</p>
